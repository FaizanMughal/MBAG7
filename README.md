### More Blood And Gore 7.0
#### (Blood For The Blood God)

--

Back when I was still working on UnSX, I had a little mutator that added extra
enhanced gore effects, mainly just improved particles and meat chunks.

The latest actually finished version was 5.0, which came with UnSX 3 V1, a 6.0
followed but it was never done, as far as I can remember. 7.0 would be part of
UnSX 3 V2... but that never happened, so here it is, all standalone.

Continuing with my "fuck mod menus" tradition, this is also configurable
directly from an ini file.

What's in here:
 * replace original blood and chunk actors whenever they're spawned
 * spawn additional blood and gore in the process
 * blood particles have some interesting physics to them
 * meat chunks have less rubber-like physics and don't float around in water
   spinning like crazy, which is really weird for original ones
 * different blood and gore types for all "vanilla" pawns (i.e.: robotic
   characters bleed sparks and oil and blow up into metal chunks).

This mutator will have unpleasant side effects when used with some of my weapon
mods, since they abuse gib spawning sometimes.
